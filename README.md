# Circuit Simulator
Copyright Â© 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology

This circuit simulator uses two js libraries: schematic.js for drawing circuits and cktsim.js for solving them.

The libraries have been written by MIT for the 6002x online course on the new MITx learning platform. I think they will be opensourcing all these libraries, and much more, soon.
